# p5js Physics Engine

You will make a block move as if it's attached to a spring!

## Getting started

### Running the app

* Clone the physics-p5js project from `https://github.com/inkwellsiesta/physics-p5js.git` into a new Cloud9 workspace
* Open your new workspace
* Double-click on `index.html`
* Click Preview -> Live Preview File at the top of the window
* Click the button in right pane next to "Browser" that says "pop out in new window"

## Instructions

**You are going to be editing `sketch.js`, don't worry about changes anywhere else**

All you have to do is fill out the ```update()``` function. Simple, right? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Once you have your block moving on a spring, try personalizing your sketch!
* Change the colors of the lines, of the block, and of the background.
* Change the mass of the block and spring constant.
* Add a second spring. 
* Add additional forces, like damping or gravity. Can you make a vertical spring?
